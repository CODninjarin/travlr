# CS-465 - Full Stack Development I
## Architecture

### Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).

- Each type of front-end tool has it's use case. Express HTML is best for simple, static webpages where the information is not going to be changing. Javascript can be used in combination with Express to give more dynamic features. SPA's are good for more dynamic pages that include user input. 

### Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

- NoSQL makes storing and retrieving large amounts of data quick and efficient whirl also being easily scalable. 

## Functionality

### How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?

- JSON is a file type and refers to the way the data is organized in the file using key:value pairs. It works well with databases for storing and retrieving information. Javascript is a programming language used, in this case, to add dynamic features to static web pages. 

### Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

- Establishing handlebars to create templates to reduce repetitive HTML code. This helps with reducing the amount of code in each file for readability, but also makes updating HTML across multiple files easier by only needing to update the template file. 


## Testing

### Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.

- I used Postman, a tool to view and test the various endpoints and methods within the program. Security was also tested this way by adding users and verifying they are added to the database and given correct permissions within the site. I also used the console within the browser to view error codes when they occurred during live testing. 

## Reflection

#### How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

- This course was my first major opportunity to combine front and back end development. I've worked with some of the tools used in this course, such as MongoDB, but much of it was new to me. I don't think I've mastered the development process, but I do feel more comfortable with it.
